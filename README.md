### Mood

## What went well

- We all worked together smoothly, no communicative issues or major conflicts.
- We met minimum requirements.

## What have we learned

- We learned about rest API testing strategies and how to apply them in our own framework. Including test actions and test matrix's, and how they are typically done in the industry.
- We used Github collaboratively and learned about the complications that may arise when working on the same project at the same time.

## What would we do differently

- We would add more user stories at the start of the project. Specifically around test cases, and how to best implement them.
- Overestimated the time it took to implement some features, so we had additional time to implement more tests that weren't reflected in the user stories or Kanban board.
